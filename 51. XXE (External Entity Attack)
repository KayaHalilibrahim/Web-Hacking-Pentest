XXE (External Entity Attack)

- It is a vulnerability that exploits XML data/parsers.

DTD in XML
- Defines the structure, legal elements and attributes of an XML document.
-!DOCTYPE: Defines the root element of the document named note.
-!ELEMENT <name>: Specifies that the named root element must contain the following elements.
-!ELEMENT to/from/heading/body: PCDATA (means parsable character data.)
-ENTITY: A configuration element used to define and reread a piece of text or data as a shortcut.

 Example: <!ENTITY name "<name>" >
- this way we can call name variable in xml code.
- <!ENTITY read SYSTEM <path>: If we give the type system, we have to give the path.
