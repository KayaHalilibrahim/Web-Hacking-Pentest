1. In-band SQLi:
- This is performed by using elements in the normal operation band (e.g., HTTP) and using resources in this band.

a. Error-based:
- It relies on being able to receive errors from the server. The extent of the vulnerability and the technique of the attack are determined based on the errors received.
- For example, consider a website that retrieves user information based on an ID number.

Source code:
$getid = "SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE user_id = '$id'";


- If we replace `$id` with `K' OR '1'='1', since the first condition is false but the second condition is true, it will return all users.


-$getid = "SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE user_id ='K' OR '1'='1'";

- If the result is in an error-based style when we don't provide it in the required format, we try again.

In a query requesting a username and password, for example:
-SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE username='' AND password=''


- In this example, if we enter `l' or 'x'='x' --` as the username, the `l` statement is false, but since `x'='x'` is true, it will proceed. The `--` statement comments out the rest (`<AND password=''>`), so it will provide output.

As comment syntax, we can use:
- #
- --
- /* */
