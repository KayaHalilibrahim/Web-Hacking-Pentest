CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

- CSRF, which stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery, is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute actions on behalf of a user (who is logged in) without their consent within a web application.

- It ranks eighth in severity on OWASP's 2013 Top 10 list of vulnerabilities.

- Among cybersecurity experts, it is known as the "sleeping giant" of security vulnerabilities.

- It is often associated with XSS and Insecure Session Management because both play a supporting role in exploiting CSRF.

- The eregi function: It checks for the presence of a desired word or word group; if not found, it does not execute. For example, when used in a URL, eregi will not perform an action if the word or word group it expects is not present in the URL. It may be used to request a username in the URL.

- The referer method: It indicates which page a request originated from. In XSS or CSRF attacks, the victim is expected to make a request with a specific referer.
