For login screens using form based authentication(Burpsuite):

- Burp suite's Intruder tool is used.

- intruder: A powerful tool used to organize automated attacks against a web application.

- We send the incoming package to the intruder by right-clicking.

- By selecting the password tried for login and password, coming to the right, clicking add, we will select it as payload.
- If we are going to use a single payload, we can use sniper as the attack type (for example, the login is known, we are trying to find the password), but if there is more than one payload (for example, if the login and password are not known), cluster bomb is used.

-If we enter the error message on the Grep-Match login screen in the settings in Intruder, the error will give an invalid value for every wrong entry, so we can find the correct username and password more easily.
