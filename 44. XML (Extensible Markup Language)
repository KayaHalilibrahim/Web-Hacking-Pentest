XML (Extensible Markup Language)

XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a language designed for storing and transporting data.

- XML files used for storage can be queried for data retrieval, similar to SQL.

- XPath is the query language for XML.

- XPath Injection bears significant similarities to SQLi attack vectors and payloads.

- XML is vulnerable compared to SQL because it lacks measures such as user authentication and access control.

- Like HTML, XML uses a tree structure.

- Within this structure, it can define internal entities or call external entities (XXE) remotely.

If externally called external entities (XXE) can be manipulated inward, exploitation occurs.

- XPath injection is also known as XML injection.

Example (bWAPP):
Since XML resembles SQL:
- ' or 1=1or "=' is tried.
