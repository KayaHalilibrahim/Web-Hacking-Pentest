Extracting DB Information with Information Schema

- Comes with relational databases upon installation.
- Maintains metadata about the database in the background.
- Sometimes we want to retrieve tables in the database instead of the data within a table, which can be done using the information schema.

To learn table names:
' UNION SELECT 1, table_name, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 FROM information_schema.tables #

- Because there are 7 columns on the current website and we can use columns 2, 3, and 4, we placed it in column 2.
- Normally, if we wanted to write it, we would use:

SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables

- `information_schema.tables` and `table_name` are constants, not variables.

- `table_schema`: gives the table schema.
