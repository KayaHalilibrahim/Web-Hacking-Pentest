Session Hijacking

- Example: (Multillidae-login/register)
- If we obtain the cookie of a highly privileged user, a lower-privileged user can log in using the high-privileged user's cookie instead of their own.

- We focus on a noticeable and changing ID. We delete this ID in Repeater and send it. If the server provides a changing ID each time, we can manipulate it.
- We send it to Sequencer to analyze the ID, identifying constant and variable parts.
- We then save this as a file and sort it in the terminal using `sort <file>` to arrange the IDs from smallest to largest.

If there is a non-existent number, it could indicate an ID already in use by another request. We take this ID, send it to Intruder, select the number, and test it by replacing the ID with the new one.
