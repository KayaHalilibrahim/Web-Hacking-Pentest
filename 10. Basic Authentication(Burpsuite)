Basic Authentication(Burpsuite):

- If we examine the packages with intercept
- Authorization: Basic <encode>
- encode: base64
- used a lot on the web.
- example: YMRt aW46MTIzNA== : is a base64.
- decode: decodes
- encode: scrambles.

- to find the login.
- we send it to the intruder.
- We make the encoder payload.
-We can use sniper because we have one.
- payload type: custom iterator
- position: enter usernames.
- We enter ":" in separator for position 1 because the decoder is that way.

* We should add and encode to payload processing and make Base64-encode as rule. To try the words that will be tried in encode form.

So in short we say
Send as -username:password -> encode.
