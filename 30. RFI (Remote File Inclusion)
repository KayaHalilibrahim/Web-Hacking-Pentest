RFI (Remote File Inclusion): URL Redirect and URL Include

- URL redirection and inclusion
- If a web page's URL contains page=<file>:
  - page=http://google.com -> it opens the page within itself and redirects to Google.
  - We could provide a malicious address instead of google.com.

- If it doesn't accept http://google.com, we can try something like hTTp://googlem.com.

- Or we can write a PHP code to start an HTTP server, then redirect the page to our HTTP page and execute our PHP code.

- Generate a payload with msfvenom and then start the HTTP server.

- Then start the multi-handler with msfconsole and begin listening.

- To obtain a shell, we redirect the target page to our HTTPS page and wait for it to open our file. When the target file opens, the shell is activated.


File Upload:
- Some file upload pages that expect a file in formats like PNG can be exploited by embedding our desired function within the file to execute it. Alternatively, we can use this to obtain a shell.
- We can use netcat or a multi-handler to get a shell.
- If the application does not accept .php files, we can use Burp Suite to intercept the request and modify the `Content-Type` to `image/jpeg`.
