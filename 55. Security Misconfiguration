Security Misconfiguration

- Occurs when security could be configured correctly but is not.

It includes:
- enabling unnecessary features such as services, pages, accounts or privileges
- default accounts whose passwords do not change
- Do not include too much detail in the http header.

- It is a security vulnerability that occurs when we do not change the default account on a site or any server.
