Burp Suite

-Intercept: means to intervene. Intercept intercepts the sent packets and takes action on whether to pass them or not.
- If intercept is open, packets come to us, we can stop them, make changes, but if it is closed, packets pass through us and can only be read.


repeater:

- It is a function that calls the requests we sent in the intercept from the history and repeats those requests.
- We do it on behalf of the person who made the request. For example, if we log in via repeater, when the client comes to the login page, he logs in directly because the repeater does it on his behalf.
