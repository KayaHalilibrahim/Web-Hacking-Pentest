injection

- If the data (input) sent by the user is not checked or filtered by the application, unwanted sensitive information may be displayed. Commands can be executed.

- Unreliable input provided by the attacker is interpreted as part of a command or code. If the interpreter relies on these inputs, it changes its operation. Returning undesirable results is also an example of this work change.

- can lead to data theft, data loss, data integrity degradation, denial of service (DOS) and breach of the entire system.


Example Injection Types:

- command injection
- SQL injection
- CRLF injection
- host header injection
- email header injection
- LDAP injection
- xss (crass-site scripting) is a type of injection.
