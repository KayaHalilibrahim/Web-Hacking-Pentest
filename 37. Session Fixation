Session Fixation

 Example (WebGoat -> Session Fixed)

Imagine we use social engineering to send a login screen to a target. Along with the login screen, we send a session ID (sid) and assign it a value. When the target logs in, the sid is recorded. If we want to access the account on behalf of the target, we can use the assigned sid value instead of the actual sid seen in the URL to log in.
