A Proxy Server:
- It's an intermediary server that sits between the client and the target server, acting as a gateway.
- Requests are first sent to the proxy server, which then forwards them to the desired target.
- Proxy servers can exist in both LAN and WAN environments.

- Proxy servers can perform various controls like allowing, denying, modifying, redirecting, or logging requests, packets, or traffic sent to them.
- It's not just for the web. So it's not just for http.
- Sometimes, we mistakenly refer to proxy servers when actually using a VPN server. The IP seen by the web server is the proxy server's IP, not ours, allowing us to access resources.

- Burp Suite can be used as a proxy server.
- Burp Suite, which includes a Proxy Server, comes pre-installed in Kali Linux.
