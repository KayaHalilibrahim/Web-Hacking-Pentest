Broken Access Control

- This occurs when mechanisms that enforce user or visitor permissions are manipulated, leading to exploitation.
- Improper implementation of security policies can allow a user to act outside their authorized limits, resulting in unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction of information.
- Examples include normal users being granted admin rights or being allowed to escalate their privileges, or bypassing access controls.
- Broken Access Control deals with authorization, not authentication.

Authentication
- Authentication is about verifying identity (who are you?).
- It results in a 401 status code (Unauthorized).

Authorization
- Authorization is about verifying permissions (what can you do?).
- It results in a 403 status code (Forbidden).
