Broken Authentication

- This is a security vulnerability that exploits weaknesses or insufficient measures in session management (login/logout) and user authentication processes. It often aims to impersonate or steal an authenticated identity (session hijacking).

- The most common type is cookie-based. It occurs by using information within the cookie sent to the client during authentication.

- The client creates a login request.
- The web server sends this request to the DB server as an Auth request.
- The DB server creates a response and a session (id).
- The web server then sends this session to the client, creating a cookie.
- This cookie contains a session id, which differentiates users.
- Session ids are created not just for logins but also when visiting a web page.
- When the session is closed, these ids usually expire, although some may persist.

- The primary purpose of cookies is to compensate for HTTP's stateless nature. They allow client and server to maintain state information without forcing them to keep track.

Example: (Multillidae-login)
- On a website's login screen, after logging in, go to Burp Suite and first change the UID in Repeater to test if it works. If it does, send it to Intruder, select the UID as the payload, and perform the attack. Review the requests and responses. Based on the results, you can log in with the IDs of users with different permissions.
