XSS reflected with HTML Injection

- We try html codes.
- If it doesn't work, we look at the source code, it may have used encode. If it asks for encode, we can encode our HTML handles and try.
- We can also try with burp suite.

- To compare low or medium input, we can send the codes of two input sources from history in burpsuite to comparer and compare there.

- We added html, for example malicious boron html code, in the get method. Then we can send this page to the target and have the malware installed. In the get method, there is information in the link, if we do not want it to be visible, we can shorten it.
